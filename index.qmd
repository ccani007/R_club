We are `Catalina Canizares` and `Micaela Lembo`, PhD students at the Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University. 

Our journey in social work and Epidemiology has been `significantly enriched by our use of R`, a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. Recognizing the immense value that R brings to research, `we are excited to share our knowledge with our colleagues`.

With this goal in mind, we have initiated the `R Club for Public Health and Social Work` aimed at Graduate Students and interested Faculty members who aspire to learn and apply `R` in their research projects. 

Through this club, we intend to build a community of R users within our college, fostering a collaborative environment where we can enhance our abilities, share insights, and contribute to each other's research projects.
